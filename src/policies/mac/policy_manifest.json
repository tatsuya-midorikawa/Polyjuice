The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { \"pattern\": \"$URL_PATTERN\", \"filter\" : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.\n\nExamples for the usage of the $FILTER section:\n\n* When $FILTER is set to { \"ISSUER\": { \"CN\": \"$ISSUER_CN\" } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.\n\n* When $FILTER contains both the \"ISSUER\" and the \"SUBJECT\" sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.\n\n* When $FILTER contains a \"SUBJECT\" section with the \"O\" value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.\n\n* When $FILTER contains a \"SUBJECT\" section with a \"OU\" value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.\n\n* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.\n\nIf you leave the policy unset, there's no autoselection for any site.",

            "description": "Overrides Microsoft Edge default printer selection rules. This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Microsoft Edge, which happens the first time a user tries to print a page.\n\nWhen this policy is set, Microsoft Edge tries to find a printer that matches all of the specified attributes and uses it as default printer. If there are multiple printers that meet the criteria, the first printer that matches is used.\n\nIf you don't configure this policy or no matching printers are found within the timeout, the printer defaults to the built-in PDF printer or no printer, if the PDF printer isn't available.\n\nThe value is parsed as a JSON object, conforming to the following schema: { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"idPattern\": { \"description\": \"Regular expression to match printer id.\", \"type\": \"string\" }, \"namePattern\": { \"description\": \"Regular expression to match printer display name.\", \"type\": \"string\" } } }\n\nOmitting a field means all values match; for example, if you don't specify connectivity Print Preview starts discovering all kinds of local printers. Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensitive.",

With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest. If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the update URL specified in the \"ExtensionInstallForcelist\" policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is the Edge Add-ons website update URL. For more details, check out the detailed guide to ExtensionSettings policy available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2161555.\n\nTo block extensions from a particular third party store, you only need to block the update_url for that store. For example, if you want to block extensions from Chrome Web Store, you can use the following JSON.\n\n{\"update_url:https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx\":{\"installation_mode\":\"blocked\"}}\n\nNote that you can still use \"ExtensionInstallForcelist\" and \"ExtensionInstallAllowlist\" to allow / force install specific extensions even if the store is blocked using the JSON in the previous example.\n\nNote: For Windows instances not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain and macOS instances not managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.",

The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.\n\nIf this policy isn't configured, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.\n\n\"DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled\" is a related policy that might also disable DNS interception checks. However, this policy is a more flexible version which might separately control intranet redirection infobars and might be expanded in the future.\nIf either \"DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled\" or this policy make a request to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.\nIf DNS interception checks are disabled by this policy but \"GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar\" is enabled, single word queries will still result in intranet navigations.\n\nPolicy options mapping:\n\n* Default (0) = Use default browser behavior.\n\n* DisableInterceptionChecksDisableInfobar (1) = Disable DNS interception checks and did-you-mean \"http://intranetsite/\" infobars.\n\n* DisableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (2) = Disable DNS interception checks; allow did-you-mean \"http://intranetsite/\" infobars.\n\n* EnableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (3) = Allow DNS interception checks and did-you-mean \"http://intranetsite/\" infobars.\n\nUse the preceding information when configuring this policy.",

Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.\n\nThe USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (\"requesting URL\") and the URL of the top-level frame site (\"embedding URL\") to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the \"urls\" field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in \"urls\" must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.\n\nIf this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the \"DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting\" policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.\n\nURL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via \"WebUsbBlockedForUrls\".
